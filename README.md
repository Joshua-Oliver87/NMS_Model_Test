# NMS_Model_Test

This repository is for testing and validating the NMS Python crop simulation model.

## Files

- `crop_model-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl`: The bundled model package (pre-built).
- `tester.py`: Script that runs the model on example input.
- `input_data.json`: Example input file with field, crop, soil, and weather parameters.
- `output_data.json`: Output file generated by the script after running the model.

## How to Use

### 1. Install the model package

In your terminal, run:

```bash
pip install crop_model-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

---

### 2. Run the test script

Once installed, run the model using:

```bash
python tester.py
```

This will:
- Read inputs from `input_data.json`, which contains the most recent testing data 
- Run the model
- Write results to `output_data.json`

##  Output Format

- **Daily simulation results** are stored at the beginning of `output_data.json`
- **Seasonal outputs and daily budget data** appear at the end of the file.
